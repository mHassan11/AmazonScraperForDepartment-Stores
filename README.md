# Amazon-Scrapper-for-Departments
The tool is developed for a client. It served the purpose of crawling specified departments and stores on Amazon. 
Requirement  
1. Python3.0+  
2.Selenium  
3.FakeUserAgent  
4.I am assuming if you use python in your day to day life you will have rest of the dependencies installed (I am just too lazy find the dependency file, Sorz)  

Disclaimer:
Scrapping is illegal and developer(s) bear no consequence for the action of the user of the tool. The tool was developed as an educational/learning experience (but for a client :P).

Have Good Day!
